These repository is a collection of useful algorithms and data structures built in MATLAB/Octave. In addition you will find solutions from project euler problem sets. The code in this repository is cross-portabel for MATLAB and for Octave.

### What is Octave?

[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free high-level interpreter language that is equivalent to the textuelle programming language MATLAB.

## Clone git repository
